Audio Social Network (Smart Speaker Social Radio)
=================================================

A radio station that you can talk to (and it will tell the
relevant people).

TODO
----
1) Get clips of past radio stations
2) Process clips of radio and lyrics into a db that expresses the
subjects and actions
3) Diarize the conversation
4) Process the clips into subjects and actions
5) Rate the accuracy of each match between radio and conversation 
in the room
6) Play the strongest match
7) Notice and record when people sing the lrics of songs
8) Layer the voices on the songs with a time bias to make a
living song
9) Allow people to choose friends (maybe on a companion app)
10) Add commands for social features such as messaging and tagging
11) Intelligently choose past clips that represent a living
viewpoint, for example allowing people to choose famous people to
be people they know so news articles about that person can be used
to talk to that person
12) Decide how much time before the clips need to be played,
this may require human input from the staff, but so do many
platforms.
13) Model the working environment so people can choose a path
and if they do what the radio says, live it, because people can
guide you through it by giving GPS style directions.
14) Work on making the environment more private by creating personal
word associations and melodic familiarity (humans completing music
automatically can be a security feature).
